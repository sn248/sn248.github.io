      <title>The humble ellipsis or three dots in R functions</title>

      <description>So, I was writing a function and within that function, I needed to call the mean function.
Of course, mean can take many arguments (see ?mean) and one of them is na.rm. I didn’t want to have na.rm as a required input in my function. I found that the way to have additional variable number of inputs in an r function is the ellipsis or three-dots operator.
A very trivial implementation is as follows:</description>

      <title>Cut a vector into n-tiles</title>

      <guid>/2016/02/08/cut-a-vector-into-n-tiles/</guid>
      <description>Useful code to cut vector into ntiles in R To break a numeric vector X into n-tiles (e.g, here into quartiles), use
y &amp;lt;- cut(X, breaks=c(quantile(X, probs = seq(0, 1, by = 0.25))), labels=c(&amp;quot;L1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;L2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;L3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;L4&amp;quot;)) Somehow, the syntax highligting is not upto mark … :( This code fragment looks much better on rouge even though, jekyll 3 is supposed to be using rouge for syntax highlighting, don’t know why this is happening or how to resolve this.</description>

      <title>Facetime Camera Fix</title>
      <link>/2016/02/06/facetime-camera-fix/</link>

      <guid>/2016/02/06/facetime-camera-fix/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes when I want to use facetime, the camera does not start automatically. Usually happens, when I have used Skype just before using facetime. Here is the fix for it, paste the following commands in the console
sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant;sudo killall VDCAssistant which I found here. Then, restart facetime. Hopefully, it will work after executing the commands above.</description>

      <description>Update: I have moved to hugo and netlify … (2017-10-28), however decided to keep the first post as is for posterity sake..
This is my first post, how exciting!
Thanks to beautiful-jekyll for the theme. Looks good and setup was a breeze due to clear and concise instructions !!
Have to remember to execute
bundle exec jekyll serve in the root of the blog directory to make sure that I can generate pages locally to check before I push them.</description>

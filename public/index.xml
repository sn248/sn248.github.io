      <description>Welcome to my site!
This site/blog is a repository of interesting technical things and a showcase of the some learnings with a few bits of code.
About me - I am a research scientist in the biopharmaceutical industry. I model pre-clinical and clinical data and try to help decision making in drug discovery and development.
I am interested in scientific computing, modeling of biological data and open-source development in general. As such, I am interested in scripting languages such as R, MATLAB, Julia, Python and a little bit of C/C++.</description>

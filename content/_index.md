Welcome to my site!

This site/blog is a repository of interesting technical things and a showcase of the some 
learnings with a few bits of code.

**About me** - I am a research scientist in the biopharmaceutical industry. I model pre-clinical
and clinical data and try to help decision making in drug discovery and development.

I am interested in scientific computing, modeling of biological data and
open-source development in general. As such, I am interested in scripting languages such as
`R`, `MATLAB`, `Julia`, `Python` and a little bit of `C/C++`. I am also interested in visualization
of biological data, literal programming, statistics and gaining an understanding of analysis methods/techniques used in 
pharmacokinetic and pharmcodynamic modeling.
  
**About this blog** - This blog is made using `R` and `blogdown` package and uses `hugo` as the static site generator. 
The theme used is `hugo-xmin`. Both `blogdown` and `hugo-xivy` have been developed
by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/) (of `rmarkdown` and `bookdown` fame). I decided to go with this minimalistic theme as it gives a sufficient framework to begin with but provides ample opportunities for understanding web development and tweaking/adding features to the site.
  
Thanks for reading!

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have moved to <code>hugo</code> and <code>netlify</code> … (2017-10-28), however decided to keep the first post as is for posterity sake..</p>
<p>This is my first post, how exciting!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">beautiful-jekyll</a> for the theme. Looks good and setup was a breeze due to clear and concise instructions !!</p>
<p>Have to remember to execute</p>
<pre class="console"><code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code></pre>
<p>in the root of the blog directory to make sure that I can generate pages locally to check before I push them. Don’t really understand the syntax of <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org/">kramdown</a> but … we will see!</p>
<p>Also, github help page <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s also test pasting a <code>gist</code></p>

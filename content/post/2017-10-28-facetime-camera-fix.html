<p>Sometimes when I want to use facetime, the camera does not start automatically. Usually happens, when I have used Skype just before using facetime. Here is the fix for it, paste the following commands in the <code>console</code></p>
<pre class="console"><code>sudo killall AppleCameraAssistant;sudo killall VDCAssistant</code></pre>
<p>which I found <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2013/12/27/fix-there-is-no-connected-camera-error-mac/">here</a>. Then, restart facetime. Hopefully, it will work after executing the commands above.</p>

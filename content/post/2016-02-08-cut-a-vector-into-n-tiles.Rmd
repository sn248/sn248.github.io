### Useful code to cut vector into ntiles in `R`
To break a numeric vector `X` into n-tiles (e.g, here into quartiles), use

```r
y <- cut(X, breaks=c(quantile(X, probs = seq(0, 1, by = 0.25))), labels=c("L1","L2","L3","L4"))
```

Somehow, the syntax highligting is not upto mark ... :(
This code fragment looks much better on [rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) even though, jekyll 3 is supposed to be using `rouge` for syntax highlighting, don't know why this is happening or how to resolve this.

Pasting the same code from a `gist`, looks much better ...

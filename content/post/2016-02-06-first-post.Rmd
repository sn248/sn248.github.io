This is my first post, how exciting!

Thanks to [beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) for the theme. Looks good and setup was a breeze due to clear and concise instructions !!

Have to remember to execute

```console
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

in the root of the blog directory to make sure that I can generate pages locally to check before I push them. Don't really understand the syntax of [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) but ... we will see!

Also, github help page [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll) for more information.

Let's also test pasting a ```gist```

**Update:** Obviously, since then I have moved to `hugo` and `netlify` ... (2017-10-28)
